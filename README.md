#Elf Invaders
I wanted to mess around with p5.js some, so I wrote this Space Invaders clone with a holiday twist.  It is just a demo and is not finished.

## TODO:
- Elves through presents at Santa
- Tweek difficulty
- Add levels
- Title screen
- Game Over screen (Santa must die!)
- High score

## Ideas:
- Revisit architecture and refactor towards entity pattern
- Decouple a bit using a mediator
- Change code to use p5's Vector class
